CHOMD config.php, /cache/, cache/tables.php to 777
Make sure the directory eoCMS is in has writable permission (777), this should already be the case if installing
in the root and will only affect those installing in folders
Go to your site where eoCMS is installed. You should be redirected to ajaxinstall.php, if not go there manually
Follow the instructions
Once completed CHMOD config.php to 644 for security reasons
